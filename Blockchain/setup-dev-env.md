# Setting up a development environment for running Ledgerium Dapps and the blockchain core

The blockchain ecosystem is a combination of multiple technologies that come together. It is overwhelming to know that so much has been achieved in a short span. The tech stacks range from  (not limited to this list) GoLang, NodeJs, Haskell, Solidity adn supporting Web3 technologies. Hence this will always remain as a living document for the team

### Basics
GoLang - There are multiple versions of golang used in different parts of the go-ethereum/Quorum ecosystem. It is recommended to use a `gvm` go version manager to switch under a development environment.

NodeJS - Multiple applications and scripts have been written in NodeJS due to the popularity of Web3 library and its support for browser and Nodejs. Fortunately (as of today) any latest version of NodeJS will be good to start. NPM is the package manager for NodeJS. 
To begin with, 
```
install NodeJS

Do, npm install in the repository (should have the package.json file)

Run the application Eg: node index.js
```
