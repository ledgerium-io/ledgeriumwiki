# Setting up a development environment for running Ledgerium Dapps and the blockchain core

The blockchain ecosystem is a combination of multiple technologies that come together. It is overwhelming to know that so much has been achieved in a short span. The tech stacks range from  (not limited to this list) GoLang, NodeJs, Haskell, Metamask, Solidity and supporting Web3 technologies. Hence this will always remain as a living document for the team.

### Basics
GoLang - There are multiple versions of golang used in different parts of the go-ethereum/Quorum ecosystem. It is recommended to use a `gvm` go version manager to switch under a development environment.

NodeJS - Multiple applications and scripts have been written in NodeJS due to the popularity of Web3 library and its support for browser and Nodejs. Fortunately (as of today) any latest version of NodeJS will be good to start. NPM is the package manager for NodeJS. 
To begin with, 
```
install NodeJS

Do, npm install in the repository (should have the package.json file)

Run the application Eg: node index.js
```

### Metamask
From their website *MetaMask is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser today. It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node. MetaMask includes a secure identity vault, providing a user interface to manage your identities on different sites and sign blockchain transactions.*

It is understood that all Ledgerium Dapps will be authorized to perform actions on the blockchain using the metamask plugin.
