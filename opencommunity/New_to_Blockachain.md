# New to Blockchain, Here's What you need to know

## What is Blockchain?
A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable record of data that is managed by cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block)are secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).The blockchain network has no central authority — it is the very definition of a democratized system. Since it is a shared and immutable ledger, the information in it is open for anyone and everyone to see.

1. Blocks store information about transactions like the date, time, and dollar amount of your most recent purchase.

2. Blocks store information about who is participating in transactions. A block for your purchase would record your name. Instead of using your actual name, your purchase is recorded without any identifying information using a unique “digital signature,” sort of like a username.

3. Blocks store information that distinguishes them from other blocks. Much like you and I have names to distinguish us from one another, each block stores a unique code called a “hash” that allows us to tell it apart from every other block. Let’s say you made a purchase, but while it’s in transit, you decide to do a second purchase. Even though the details of your new transaction would look nearly identical to your earlier purchase, we can still tell the blocks apart because of their unique codes.
 
## How Does Blockchain Work?
Picture a spreadsheet that is duplicated thousands of times across a network of computers. Then imagine that this network is designed to regularly update this spreadsheet.

Information held on a blockchain exists as a shared — and continually integrated — database. The blockchain database isn’t stored in any single location, meaning the records it keeps are truly public and easily verifiable. No centralized version of this information exists for corruption. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, its data is accessible to anyone on the internet.

The reason why the blockchainis so popular:
1. It is not owned by a single entity, hence it is decentralized
2. The data is cryptographically stored inside
3. The blockchain is immutable, so no one can tamper with the data that is inside the blockchain
4. The blockchain is transparent so one can track the data if they want to

## What is Ledgerium and how is it powered by Blockchain?
Ledgerium Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that can record transactions between parties efficiently in a verifiable and permanent way. This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions instantly and inexpensively.Ledgerium Blockchain is an Ethereum/Quorum based distributed digital ledger that will record public and private transactions between parties efficiently in a verifiable and permanent way. 

Some of the features of Ledgerium Blockchain are:
* Distributed and Decentralised
* Immutable
* Public and Private Transactions
* High Throughput
* Scalable
* High Availability
* Secured



## What is Ledgerium trying to solve? 
The CFEs estimated that the typical organization lost 5% of revenue in 2016 as a result of fraud. The total loss caused by the cases in the study exceeded \$6.3 billion, with an average loss per case of \$2.7 million.
There are numerous fraud cases around the world, that have happened to different firms. And it is not surprising that it will keep happening again and again, as the current industry system has serious defects, the reasons being the ‘conflict of interest’ and ‘trust’.
Auditors involved in verifying the accuracy of financial statements are in a strange position because they perform the audit by charging the clients. This behaviour creates a problem: the audited financial information may be compromised by the auditor in order to please the clients. Auditors only need to provide a reasonable assurance according to the risk assessment of a certain materiality level, and do not provide a complete guarantee of the figures.
Accounting and financial transactions are ultimately made due to trust and transparency. The ability to back trace, modify and to issue false sales or manipulate the profits have led investors to have an inherent lack of trust in the business.


__Ledgerium applications include:__ 
* An accounting data Blockchain with a distributed ledger across many nodes in the Ledgerium Blockchain, which can also keep record of cryptocurrencies.

* A Debtor and Creditor ecosystem with smart contract functionality, to optimise the traditional accounts payable and receivable function.

* Real-time auditing of Blockchains, and the use of artificial intelligence to achieve auditing automation.

* The internal control of Blockchains, including inventory, supply chain, ownership of tangible assets, ownership of intangible assets, internal procedures, etc.

* A complete solution for accounting and Blockchain auditing software in the future.

## How Ledgerium try to solve this problem?
The Block Ledger, a company behind Ledgerium Blockchain, brings an e-invoicing and financial accounting reconciliation product named Luca+ to the market place which leverages Ledgerium Blockchain to maintain audit trails and transparency. 

Luca+ is a middleware SAAS based application which connects business and finance tools, allowing the communication and transfer of data between different platforms. For every state of the invoice, it is writing the transactions on __Ledgerium Blockchain__, which makes the invoice data immutable, transparent and secure.
