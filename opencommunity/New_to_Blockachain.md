# New to Blockchain, Here's What you need to know

## What is Blockchain?
A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable record of data that is managed by cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block)are secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).The blockchain network has no central authority — it is the very definition of a democratized system. Since it is a shared and immutable ledger, the information in it is open for anyone and everyone to see.

1. Blocks store information about transactions like the date, time, and dollar amount of your most recent purchase.

2. Blocks store information about who is participating in transactions. A block for your purchase would record your name. Instead of using your actual name, your purchase is recorded without any identifying information using a unique “digital signature,” sort of like a username.

3. Blocks store information that distinguishes them from other blocks. Much like you and I have names to distinguish us from one another, each block stores a unique code called a “hash” that allows us to tell it apart from every other block. Let’s say you made a purchase, but while it’s in transit, you decide to do a second purchase. Even though the details of your new transaction would look nearly identical to your earlier purchase, we can still tell the blocks apart because of their unique codes.
 
## How Does Blockchain Work?
Picture a spreadsheet that is duplicated thousands of times across a network of computers. Then imagine that this network is designed to regularly update this spreadsheet.

Information held on a blockchain exists as a shared — and continually integrated — database. The blockchain database isn’t stored in any single location, meaning the records it keeps are truly public and easily verifiable. No centralized version of this information exists for corruption. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, its data is accessible to anyone on the internet.

The reason why the blockchainis so popular:
1. It is not owned by a single entity, hence it is decentralized
2. The data is cryptographically stored inside
3. The blockchain is immutable, so no one can       tamper with the data that is inside the         blockchain
4. The blockchain is transparent so one can         track the data if they want to

## What is Ledgerium and how is it powered by Blockchain?
The Blockledger brings Blockchain to the accounting and audit industry. We utilize a decentralized ledger through a triple entry accounting system. Ledgerium Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that can record transactions between parties efficiently in a verifiable and permanent way. This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions instantly and inexpensively. The merits of Blockchain technology are exactly matching the requirements of the accounting and auditing industry. 
## What is Ledgerium trying to solve? 
Ledgerium focuses on creating a decentralized ledger through a triple entry accounting system that will revolutionise Audit Confirmation, AP/AR Management, and Trust Account Audit. The platform will allow tamper proof and secure transactions, while delivering significant time and cost saving compare to traditional platform and processes.


__Ledgerium applications include:__ 
* An accounting data Blockchain with a distributed ledger across many nodes in the Ledgerium Blockchain, which can also keep record of cryptocurrencies.

* A Debtor and Creditor ecosystem with smart contract functionality, to optimise the traditional accounts payable and receivable function.

* Real-time auditing of Blockchains, and the use of artificial intelligence to achieve auditing automation.

* The internal control of Blockchains, including inventory, supply chain, ownership of tangible assets, ownership of intangible assets, internal procedures, etc.

* A complete solution for accounting and Blockchain auditing software in the future.
