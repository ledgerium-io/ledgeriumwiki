# Contributing
Ledgerium Blockchain is an Ethereum/Quorum based open public blockchain that will record public and private transactions between parties efficiently in a verifiable and permanent way. We are delighted to receive contributions of anything from minor fixes to significant new features. 

### For Beginners:
* File bugs/tickets if they are not already filed.
    * Software bugs
    * Feature bugs
    * 
    * 

* Contribute for better documentation and raise a PR
* If you're looking for some starter projects, we maintain a [list of issues suitable](https://github.com/ledgerium-io/ledgeriumwiki/issues) for new developers.

There are plenty of ways to help outside writing ledgerium code. Code review of pull requests (even if you are not a committer), feature suggestions, reporting bugs, [documentation]() and usability feedback all matter immensely. Another significant way to help is through our [Repositories](https://github.com/ledgerium-io/), which are available in a variety of languages. If you develop a new one, we'll be happy to include it on the list.

## Getting your changes accepted

Patches to Ledgerium are done through GitHub pull requests.

Pull requests require one approval (+1) from an established committer on code and text (for documentation) levels. The exception is major architectural changes or API changes, and/or changes to
warrant additional design and compatibility review. Such pull requests require design approvals from three different committers (one of them could also be the author of the pull request). For those, it can help to discuss things on the Ledgerium Blockchain Developer list or a Github issue beforehand.

In general, please follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ledgerium-io/ledgeriumwiki/blob/feature/lb-23/opencommunity/contributing_guidlines.md) when sending in pull requests. This will help review proceed as quickly as possible.
